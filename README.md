# Multi Tenant Plugin Experiment

## TODO

- [ ] rename tenants to avalanche centers (I think this would be nice to make the platform feel more customized for non-technical users, small thing - or just the display name of it?)
- [ ] try out global tenant-scoped collections using navigation collection
- [ ] how does the multi tenant plugin work with Media and other payload plugins that come with collections?
